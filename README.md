3.Connect to the Bluetooth Device
4.Choose your LED Strip count

In Arduino sketch you should:
1. Set the LED pin
2. Set the TX/RX pin
3. Set the LED count

You can choose one of nine modes, and if you hold the MODE 5 button, you can change ALL LED strip color.

On the mode page, you can set the color of EVERY LED, which you want. Just tap on the necessary circle.
